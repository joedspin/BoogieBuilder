# Boogie Builder
Boogie Builder puts you in charge of the dance floor!

You're the DJ, remixer, and lighting person! Click play to start then you can gradually build up a funky disco groove by adding and removing any of 12 different instrument parts. Start small and slowly add in more parts. Each part you add will also enhance the light show.

Once you've enjoyed playing around with the first mix, change to Red Mode to try your hand at remixing a different disco classic.

There are endless possibilities when you play with Boogie Builder you can get your dance floor shaking all night!

Get on up and get down!
